- previous experience description:
	- My role was to deliver devops solutions for a 
	  team of embeded developers. I was the only devops engineer in my team, 
	  meaning every new solution that was supplied was desgined, executed, 
	  documented and maintained by me. Some of my accomplishments during the 
	  rule were, but not limited to:
	  1. Improving pre-existing cicd infrastructure.
	  2. Moving the team into more advanced technologies, f.e utilizing openshift for automationk needs.
	  3. Designing and executing requested and self-though features and solutions.
